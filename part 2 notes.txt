Timer app: instead of sequential code flipping back and forth between our two functionalities (countdown of timer, and animated circle), we can use event-based
	coding. where something may trigger an event and that itself will animate the circle.
	> Solving the 'this' issue. We learned new ways of using 'bind', 'call', or 'apply' to pass in an argument of 'this'. Check screenshot.
