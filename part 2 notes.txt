Timer app: instead of sequential code flipping back and forth between our two functionalities (countdown of timer, and animated circle), we can use event-based
	coding. where something may trigger an event and that itself will animate the circle.
	> Solving the 'this' issue. We learned new ways of using 'bind', 'call', or 'apply' to pass in an argument of 'this'. Check screenshot.

	Have 2 options on how to update the time remaining (tick). Either store the time left as an instance variable, or store it in the input element (storing inside DOM)

	SVG Elements are HTML elements. Top left corner is the Origin. X-axis increases from left to right. Y-axis increases from top to bottom. You won't have negative X/Y
		Can show multiple shapes in one SVG area
		Circles have a Fill (inside part), and Stroke (border)
		Border or stroke-dasharray, starts being drawn from the right side then goes clockwise. same as circumference (2 * PI * r)

Application Design Pattern: Plan of attack -> Setup boilerplate code -> Identify challenging aspects of the project we're about to work on -> Get started on the project
	Movie Fight app: Big challenges: Need to somehow fetch data about movies (hard-code? or API?), need auto-complete widget from scratch, styling CSS to make it nice
	APIs usually have two return actions. A Listing (Indexing) result or a Show result
	OMDb API key: e7a59c4a
	With Axios we can pass along an object with parameters for requesting the API
	Debouncing: Waiting for some time to pass after the last event to actually do something.
		A reusable debounce function wraps the initial function and gives it a "shield" to protect from requests that are too fast
